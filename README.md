## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project (as a part of refreshing basic pandas skills), I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2022 to better understand:

1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above question.  The notebook only contains very basic data exploration and cleaning activities. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
